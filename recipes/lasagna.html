              <li>Heat a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat.</li>

              <li>Season with <strong>1 tsp sugar</strong>, <strong>1 tsp dried basil</strong>, <strong>1 tsp dried oregano</strong>, <strong>salt</strong>, and <strong>pepper</strong>.</li>
              <li>Simmer the sauce on low heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add <strong>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</strong> toward the end.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
              <li>Add <strong>12 lasagna noodles</strong> and cook according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
              <li>Drain and lay the noodles flat on a baking sheet to prevent sticking.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>In a mixing bowl, combine <strong>16 oz ricotta cheese</strong>, <strong>1 large egg</strong>, <strong>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</strong>, <strong>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</strong>, and <strong>1/2 tsp salt</strong>.</li>
              <li>Stir until well mixed.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>375°F (190°C)</strong>.</li>
              <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom.</li>
              <li>Add a layer of <strong>3-4 lasagna noodles</strong>, slightly overlapping.</li>
              <li>Spread <strong>1/3 of the ricotta mixture</strong> over the noodles.</li>
              <li>Spoon <strong>1/3 of the meat sauce</strong> over the ricotta, and sprinkle <strong>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</strong>.</li>
              <li>Repeat the layers two more times (noodles, ricotta, meat sauce, mozzarella).</li>
              <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, remaining meat sauce, and <strong>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bake the Lasagna:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from burning).</li>
              <li>Bake in the preheated oven for <strong>25 minutes</strong>.</li>
              <li>Remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional <strong>10-15 minutes</strong>, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rest and Serve:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for <strong>10 minutes</strong>. This helps it set, making it easier to slice.</li>
              <li>Garnish with fresh basil if desired, and serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
    </ol>
